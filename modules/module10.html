 My scrum team did great. It included: Katie, Josh, Ian, and Chris. We went around in a group and showed each of our pages and told each other what we think they needed to change. For example, we all agreed Ian needed to change his color scheme, and once he did it looked so much better! We also talked about the spacing of Chris' home page for the wording.  I asked my group about the spacing and they helped me ont he editing page figure out to move over the words, and they also helped me decide to put copyright at the bottom. The positive reinforcement about my landing page made me feel really confident which was great.  We didn't go through too many obstacles except that whenever we would critique someones page, they would like it (even if the rest of us did't).  Katie was an expert at the fonts and showed me mine were inconsistent, which was a great help! Overall I think our group did a great job of helping one another on the details (spacing, colors, fonts, ect.) in our websites.  I think going to a group for input is a wonderful idea because, as we realized, sometimes we personally like things that are not appealing to the masses and need to be changed.  I also learned to ask effective questions when referring to specifics. An example of this is: Do you like the centered text on the resume page? Instead of a broad question like: Do you like the text?  Also when I asked for technical help I made sure I had a specific problem, before I asked you for your help!  Thank you for the help Christie, I couldn't of done it without you.

   Our group was very efficient in our groups. We would spend 20 minutes per person and go through each detail.  Our goals were mainly to help everyone in the group.  MY goals included fixing any major errors every time I went into class with one.  I usually completed this goal, and walked out of the class with a more usable website!

My support came from my group members, the internet, and you(my professor). For all esthetics I would ask my group.  Katie was good at spacing, Ian was good at overall appearance, Chris was good at technical details, and Josh was good at colors!  They all had their input and it helped me have a well rounded, critiqued site.  Then for technical questions I would first do my internet research, but if I still couldn't figure it out I would then ask you what to do.  Which was the biggest help.  My online resources were blogs about people who were working on similar aspects of their websites(and I would read them, never posted a question), and the website http://www.w3schools.com/ was extremely helpful and I used it a ton.  Then I referred to codecademly a lot as well.  That is a summary of all my online and human resources, when completing this website.
