 	After reviewing my project I can make two distinct categories.  These categories are my landing page and then the rest of the content pages.  The reasons this makes such dramatically different categories and the same CSS cannot be used on both pages is because they are so different.  The landing page is made of boxes and the CSS is all the pixel sizes for these boxes as well as the colors.  Then I have the CSS for the headings within the boxes and the images on the landing page.  This is very different to the CSS to the content pages which will be the same throughout the project because their will be the same title image as well as navigation.
  </p>
  The way I went about the boxes, and keeping them separate from the content pages, is through creating html in a specific dividers that will only apply to the landing page.  These dividors are labeled by which box they are.  For example box1 is the first box at the top right.  It is a pinkish color, which in HTML is #38040b and is 220px by 300px.  This is an example of the 17 boxes I created all of different sizes and colors, but perfectly fit together within the webpage.  Next their are the images on this landing page.  Their are 4 images that were sized accordingly to fit. Finally I have 5 names of pages that will be able to be clicked in the future (have not gotten there yet).  These pages are labeled h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5.  All of the aspects to the landing page are in divisors so they will never interfere with the other pages.
  <p>
    On the other hand the content pages are not set up in divisors because they will be used in all of the content pages.  Specifically the header image which is called just img and the html connecting the image to the CSS of centering it will be on the HTML for each content page.  Then the navigation labeled, nag, will be on every page.  This includes specific font, Century Gothic, and specific font size and color.  Next I created these lines above and below the navigation under the hr tab that will be copied on each content page.

    Continuing this process I will definitely make sure that I apply the CSS to the rest of the content pages, and will see if their is any way to make the structure of the content pages the same with each one.  Then I would be able to do the CSS one time for the content pages structure and be done with it.  I am still unsure of this because I may need different structures per page with the different information.  I feel accomplished in what I have done and the constant CSS for my content pages, and how I am complete with separated CSS for my landing page.  I need to make each specific content page now, and develop the CSS for them.  Then I need to link the content pages to the landing page. Overall though I feel I have done a great job with this and do the connection from HTML to CSS is great.
